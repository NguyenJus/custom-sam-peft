## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-23

### Breaking — v0.x debt paydown ("hardening pass", issue #26)

This release rewrites the YAML schema, CLI surface, and internal seams to
make the user-facing API small and obvious. Upgrade by editing your YAML
manually against the rename table below — there is intentionally no
migration tool (pre-1.0; README already declares this).

#### YAML field renames

| Old | New | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `train.lr` | `train.learning_rate` | `"lr"` is an abbreviation; `"learning_rate"` matches the concept and is self-documenting. |

The following fields were **considered** for rename but kept as-is:

| Field | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| `train.batch_size` | No rename — already consistent with common ML convention. |
| `run.output_dir` | No rename — already consistent. |
| `tracking.wandb.project` | No rename — already consistent. |

#### Removed fields

- `EvalConfig.metrics` — was silently ignored by `compute_coco_map`; removed.
  Re-introduction tracked in follow-up issue (see below).
- `BoxHintSchedule.early_stop_p_threshold` — was unused; removed pending
  early-stopper implementation.

#### Demoted fields (no longer user-set; hardcoded as internal defaults)

The following config dataclasses are now internal-only and have been moved to
`src/custom_sam_peft/config/_internal.py`. Import from `config._internal`
in new code; the old names remain re-exported from `config.schema` for
backward compatibility through this PR.

- `MatcherWeights` — box supervision is deferred; `lambda_l1` / `lambda_giou`
  are now hardcoded constants.
- `LossConfig` — `focal_gamma` / `focal_alpha` are never set by users; now
  hardcoded.
- `WandbConfig` — rarely set by users; demoted to internal default.
- `ExportConfig` — single-field dataclass; demoted to internal.

#### CLI command flag changes

- `train` gains bare `--eval` and `--export` flags.
- `eval` gains a bare `--export` flag.
- `run` is now documented as an alias for `train --eval --export`.

#### New error taxonomy

- `CustomSamPeftError` — base class for all user-facing errors.
- `ConfigError` — missing, malformed, or invalid config value.
- `DataError` — dataset-loading or example-decoding failures.
- `ModelError` — model construction, patch-application, or adapter failures.
- `CheckpointError` — checkpoint read/write or resume-state mismatches.
- `EnvironmentError` — runtime precondition failures (HF gating, missing GPU,
  missing extra).
- CLI renders errors in a four-part shape (summary / expected / found / fix).
  Re-run with `-v` for the full traceback.

#### Internal refactors

- `Runtime` value object centralizes device + dtype + rank-awareness.
  `is_primary` and `world_size` fields are seam scaffolding for future
  DDP / FSDP work.
- `paths/` module owns the run-dir layout; no more string-joined
  `runs/.../checkpoints/` outside `paths/`.
- `_bootstrap.py` is the sole site for adapter registration, seeding, and
  logging configuration.
- `_patch_*` functions each live in their own file under
  `src/custom_sam_peft/models/_patches/`; `Sam3Patches.apply` is the
  single application site.
- `EvalArtifacts` is the seam between `Trainer` and `Evaluator`.
- PEFT method-string branches (`if peft.method == "lora": ...`) replaced
  by `PEFTMethod` protocol dispatch throughout.
- Static guards in CI enforce: no method-string branches outside
  `peft_adapters/`, no `.to(device)` outside collator + `runtime/`, no
  string-joined checkpoint paths outside `paths/`.
